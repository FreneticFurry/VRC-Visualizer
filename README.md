# VRC-Visualizer
a simple python audio visualizer for VRChat!

_{Requirements}_
1. Python
2. these libs: pip install psutil python-osc sounddevice numpy   (just copy and paste that into powershell)
3. VB-Audio Cable: https://download.vb-audio.com/Download_CABLE/VBCABLE_Driver_Pack43.zip & abit of knowledge of audio routing (if anyone wants a tutorial on setting this up n such just ask and ill quickly make that for this entire visualilzer ma-bober :D)
4. Unity
5. create 11 animations for 0-1 with a blend tree and name it "LowHighF", "LowHighF1" and so on til LowHighF10 (if anyone wants this to also be just a Unitypackage i can do that aswell)
6. VRCFury: https://vrcfury.com/download(without using this the visualizer will look really out of wack for network users because vrchat devs are wack as always

_{Side Note}_
this was made with new users in mind and to be as friendly as i could think of to maybe help a newer user figure out Python for the people interested in learning it though their own ways! (though the code probably kinda sucks i made an attempt lol)

hope you enjoy & make some cool funky stuff :)
